# GBA-Logs
GBA-Logs for various test roms. 

These files were generated in NanoBoyAdvance by outputting register values in the following order as uint32_t before each instruction was executed. If you do not do instruction pipeline emulation, skip the first two instructions (2x18x4 Bytes) in the log. 

- r0
- r1
- r2
- r3
- r4
- r5
- r6
- r7
- r8
- r9
- r10
- r11
- r12
- r13
- r14
- r15
- CPSR
- SPSR (Same as CPSR for ARM modes without SPSR)

The data is tightly packed contiguously, and there is no header or other data between instructions. Additionally, the BIOS was skipped while generating these logs. 

The logs correspond to the following roms: 

| Log      | ROM | Notes | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| arm-log.bin      | arm.gba       | https://github.com/jsmolka/gba-tests/tree/master/arm |
| armwrestler-log.bin      | armwrestler.gba       | Just the portion to get to the menu screen  |
| kirby-boot-log.bin      | Kirby Return to Dream Land ROM      | Captured up to the HAL logo being displayed  |
| redp-log.bin      | redp.gba       |   |
| thumb-gang-log.bin      | thumb-gang.gba       |   |
